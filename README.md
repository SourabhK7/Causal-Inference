# Executive Summary
We conducted statistical experimentation to determine the impact of change in marketing channels from
telephone to a cellphone. Our analysis showed that if we reach a customer via cellphone, the chances of term
deposit renewal are 24% more than the traditional telephone method. Further, we identified that if we get
the customer more than four times, the chances of term-deposit renewals start decreasing.
Based on our analysis, we would recommend the marketing teams design future marketing campaigns using a
cellphone as a mode of communication and limit the frequency of the call to 4 during the campaign period,
maximizing the chances of term-deposit renewals.
